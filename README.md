## _**`hi there,`**_
ðŸŒˆ I'm a software engineer, based in London with an interest in crafting beautiful user interfaces.

I want to build applications that improve people's lives, in the technologies that are best suited to the task. I love collaborating with a diverse group of people and opinions and thrive in environments that encourage failing fast.
